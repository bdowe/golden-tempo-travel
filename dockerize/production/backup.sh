#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Nightly Postgres backup for the goldentempotravel.com production stack.
#
# Dumps the database from the running postgres container (pg_dump custom
# format, gzipped), prunes local dumps older than RETENTION_DAYS, and — if
# rclone is installed with the configured remote — copies the new dump
# off-site. Designed for cron:
#
#   10 4 * * * /opt/goldentempo/backup.sh >> /var/log/goldentempo-backup.log 2>&1
#
# Exit status: non-zero if the dump itself fails (cron mails/logs it);
# a missing/unconfigured rclone only warns and exits 0 (off-site copy is
# best-effort, the local dump already succeeded).
#
# Every path/name is overridable via env so the script can be dry-run
# against another stack (e.g. the dev compose) without touching this file:
#
#   COMPOSE_FILE      compose file of the stack to back up
#                     (default /opt/goldentempo/docker-compose.yml)
#   COMPOSE_PROJECT   compose project name; empty => derived by compose
#                     from the compose-file directory (default empty)
#   BACKUP_DIR        where dumps land (default /opt/goldentempo/backups)
#   PG_SERVICE        compose service name of postgres (default postgres)
#   PG_USER / PG_DB   database credentials (default travel / travel_planner)
#   RETENTION_COUNT   how many dumps to keep, locally AND on the remote
#                     (default 10; count-based so a stalled backup job can
#                     never age-out every existing copy)
#   RCLONE_REMOTE     rclone destination (default r2:goldentempo-backups)
#   BACKUP_HEARTBEAT_FILE  freshness marker written on a good local dump
#                     (default $BACKUP_DIR/.last_success); the API's
#                     /admin/ops/health reads it to detect stale backups
