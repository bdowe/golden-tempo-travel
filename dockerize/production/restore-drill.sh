# Restore drill for the goldentempotravel.com Postgres backups.
#
# Codifies the "verify a dump into a throwaway volume" half of restore.md
# (steps 0–3) as a repeatable, non-destructive check: it NEVER touches the live
# stack or its data volume. It restores the latest (or a named) dump into a
# scratch postgres container, runs a sanity SELECT count(*) on a core table,
# reports PASS/FAIL, and tears the scratch container down.
#
# Run it periodically (or from a systemd timer) so "we have backups" is proven,
# not assumed. Exit status is 0 on PASS, non-zero on FAIL.
#
# Every knob overrides via env so it can drill any stack's dumps:
#
#   BACKUP_DIR      where dumps live (default /opt/goldentempo/backups)
#   PG_DB           database name inside the dump (default travel_planner)
#   PG_USER         role to restore as (default travel)
#   DUMP            explicit dump path (default: newest ${PG_DB}-*.dump.gz)
#   CORE_TABLE      table the sanity count runs against (default users)
#   PG_IMAGE        scratch postgres image (default postgres:16-alpine)
#   SCRATCH_NAME    scratch container name (default pg-restore-drill)
