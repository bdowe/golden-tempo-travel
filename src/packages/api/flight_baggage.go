// the bare fare hides the price the traveler actually pays. When a search
// names a carry_on or checked tier, every offer is classified against its
// included allowance, and for the top-ranked offers that lack the bag we
// fetch Duffel's purchasable bag price (one extra API call per offer — the
// reason for the top-K budget) and rank on the effective total instead.
