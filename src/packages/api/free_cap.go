// Free-cap soft instrumentation (specs/free-cap-instrumentation): measure the
// business model's placeholder free caps WITHOUT enforcing anything. When a
// signed-in user crosses a cap — the first unit past it, never subsequent
// ones — a server-side free_cap_would_hit analytics event is recorded so the
// admin dashboard can answer the Phase-3 trigger question ("is a measured
// cohort actually hitting the free caps?"). Everything here is strictly
// fail-open: counting off the best-effort analytics_events log undercounts in
// degraded mode (acceptable for a demand signal — see the spec's accuracy
// model and its usage_counters upgrade path for strict metering), and any
// error simply skips the signal. No request is ever rejected, delayed, or
// altered. Cribbed from price_alert_handler.go's maxActiveAlertsPerUser
// template, minus the enforcement branch.

// plan_session_started events in the trailing 30 days — prior, because this

// started never counts itself. Emit free_cap_would_hit iff prior == cap:
// sessions 1..cap are within the free tier, session cap+1 is the first that
// would have been blocked and the only one that emits (prior > cap emits
// nothing). The would-hit is written BEFORE the started event so that once a
// session's started row is visible, any crossing it implies is visible too
// (what the integration test polls on). Concurrent same-user starts can race
// the threshold either way; accepted — the signal is approximate by design.
